//! The release workflow attests the crate it publishes.
//!
//! A version on crates.io says nothing about where it was built: anyone
//! holding a publish token could have uploaded it from their own machine.
//! `release.yml` therefore packages the crate, publishes it, checks that
//! the file it packaged is byte-for-byte the one crates.io serves, and
//! signs a build-provenance attestation over that file with the
//! workflow's own identity. The same `.crate` is attached to the GitHub
//! release for the tag, so anyone can check a download with
//!
//! ```text
//! gh attestation verify <crate> --repo <owner>/<repo> \
//!     --signer-workflow <owner>/<repo>/.github/workflows/release.yml
//! ```
//!
//! Nothing else notices if that step goes. The workflow runs only on a
//! version tag, and a release without an attestation publishes exactly
//! as green as one with it; the gap would surface the first time someone
//! tried to verify a download, long after the version was taken. This
//! file makes the loss loud on the pull request that causes it.
//!
//! It also keeps the privileges where they are needed. The attesting job
//! must be able to mint an OIDC token, write an attestation and attach a
//! release asset; no other job, and not the workflow as a whole, may
//! hold any of those grants.
//!
//! The workflow is PARSED rather than scanned, so a step name, a comment
//! or a quoted string cannot satisfy a check meant for a real step.
