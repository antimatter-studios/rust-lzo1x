# No tracked file names an application built on top of this crate.
#
# This crate is a standalone project (AGENTS.md: "Never mention a consuming
# application in the README, the source, or CLI help"). A name slips in the
# easy way -- a test header recalling the field incident that prompted it,
# a comment saying which product ships on which architecture -- and nothing
# else here would notice (#21). So this reads EVERY tracked file: source,
# tests, scripts, docs, workflows, the changelog. Comments included: a name
# in a comment is still a name in the repository.
#
# THE NAME LIST LIVES HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. Each entry is a
# case-insensitive extended regex, so one entry covers the spellings of one
# name. This file is the one place allowed to spell them, and the only file
# the scan does not read.
