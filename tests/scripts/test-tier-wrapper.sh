# rust-fs-core's scripts/tier.sh, run in place, keeps every promise chores.yml
# makes on its behalf.
#
# The runner is rust-fs-core's and is NOT committed here, so this guard drives
# the real one, from the ../rust-fs-core checkout at the pinned version, in a
# sandbox -- so a change in core's behaviour shows up here rather than in a CI
# log three repositories away.
#
# What is proven, and why each one is worth a check:
#
#   1. a green tier prints ONE line and puts the transcript in tmp/logs/
#   2. a tier that breaches its line budget exits 65, not 0 and not 1
#   3. a tier that breaches its byte budget exits 65 as well
#   4. a failing command's OWN status is what tier.sh exits with
#   5. a failure prints no tail by default, and OUTPUT_BUDGET_FAIL_TAIL brings
#      one back
#   6. --verbose streams the run AND still enforces the budget
#
# It accumulates failures rather than stopping at the first: a guard that
# stops early answers one question per run, and these checks are independent.
