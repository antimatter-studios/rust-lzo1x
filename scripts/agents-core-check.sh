#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Verify AGENTS.md carries the shared agent-core block, unmodified.
#
# Every repository in this family embeds the same block between BEGIN/END
# markers, so an agent moving between them is told the same rules. This script
# is what stops that from quietly ceasing to be true: it hashes the content
# between the markers and compares it against the canonical digest below.
#
# The digest covers ONLY the content between the markers -- never the marker
# lines themselves, which carry the digest and so cannot be part of it.
#
# WHEN THE BLOCK CHANGES, it changes everywhere: edit the canonical copy, then
# update the digest in this script and in the BEGIN marker of every repository
# that carries it. A repo left behind fails this check rather than silently
# running last month's rules.
#
# NO TOOLCHAIN. It is `grep`, `awk` and a SHA-256, so it needs no cargo build:
# tests/scripts/test-agents-core.sh runs it in the CI test job's shell-test
# step, on the ubuntu and the macOS leg alike, and `chore lint` runs it too.
