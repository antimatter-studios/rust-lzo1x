# semver-check.sh — refuse a public-API break the version does not declare.
#
# Compares this crate's public API against the newest version PUBLISHED TO
# CRATES.IO — not a tag, not origin/main — with cargo-semver-checks, and fails
# when the change needs a bigger bump than Cargo.toml's version makes. For a
# 0.x crate a break needs the minor to move (0.4.0 -> 0.5.0); an addition
# needs at least the patch.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. A break published as a patch breaks every `^0.x` consumer's
# build on its next `cargo update`, and the only thing standing in the way was
# a person remembering to bump the version. In one week two sibling crates had
# breaks sitting on main under a version already published: a new `Error`
# variant in antimatter-studios/rust-fs-xfs#292, caught only by a hand bump in
# the release PR, and two Rust-API breaks in christhomas/rust-fs-ntfs#399.
# rust-fs-ext4 met the shape first and added this gate
# (christhomas/rust-fs-ext4#120); a step a person has to remember is the step
# that goes missing, so this one runs on every pull request.
#
# THE BASELINE IS THE REGISTRY because that is what a consumer has. A tag can
# exist for a version that never published, and a version can publish from a
# commit no tag names; the registry is the one list a downstream `cargo update`
# actually reads.
#
# WHAT IT CANNOT SEE. A change of behaviour behind an unchanged signature, and
# anything in the C ABI: cargo-semver-checks reads Rust items, not a C
# struct's layout or an exported function's arity as a C caller sees it. Those
# still need a changelog line written by a person.
#
# cargo-semver-checks is MIT/Apache-2.0. CARGO_SEMVER_CHECKS_VERSION pins the
# version CI installs; a different local one is reported, not refused.
